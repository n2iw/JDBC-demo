# JDBC Demo
 
This is a JDBC demo project for Fall 2017 ICSI518 Software Engineering course, at University at Albany.

This demo accesses database in the controller action, which is not recommended for a real life project.

I recommend use POJOs to represent data objects, and a DAO classes to do all the database operations.

A Sample database can be imported from file "online_course.sql", only "user" table is used in this demo.
