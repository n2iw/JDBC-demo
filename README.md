# JDBC Demo
 
This is a JDBC demo project for Fall 2017 ICSI518 Software Engineering course, at University at Albany.

## Technologies used

- JSF 2.2
- Mysql 5
- Tomcat 8.5

## Note

This demo accesses database in a controller action, which is not recommended for a real life project.

I recommend use POJOs to represent data objects, and DAO classes to do all the database operations.

A sample database can be imported from file "online_course.sql", only "user" table is used in this demo.
